This is a palindrome checker project.
in this project i will build a palindrome checker which function is to check if a letter is spelt the same way if spelt in both direction.
I have finished the building the html element and also styled the page with the css.
i am currently adding js function in order for the palindrome to work as it's suppose to.
i just completed my project.
it works exactly as expected.
